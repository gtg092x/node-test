# Node back-end test for Matthew Drake

To test, enter the follow command from project root:

    node app

Once launched, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/wordCombinations` use a query parameter `q` for your input.

The following will return the word hello

    http://localhost:8080/api/wordCombinations?q=43556

## To run the Unity example

There is not a published build with the included unity project at `unity/`. Instead just run the unity project with a Unity3d 5.0 installation.

The localhost route is hardcoded to this sample project.
